I"æ<p>Last week I have been to the first <a href="gophercon.in">gopherconindia</a> happened at Banglore, India. It was fun and there were lots of good talks about <a href="go-lang.org">golang</a> that really inspired me to start diving into Go, it requires a separate post of its own.</p>

<p>Anyway, being travelling for the first time and meeting people I had an unusual urge to write down my experiences of the day and how I felt just hot out of the stove. Yeah, a journal in short. I was first prepared to start writing in age old Pen and Paper, but given the current conveniences out there I donâ€™t want to stick with a diary that I canâ€™t tag and have to limit one per year and cutting out truth with fear of someone might read it.</p>
