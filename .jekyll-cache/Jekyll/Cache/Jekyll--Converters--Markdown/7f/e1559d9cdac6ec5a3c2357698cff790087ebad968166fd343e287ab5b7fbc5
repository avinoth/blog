I"ã<p>Ever since I have completed my basics in <a href="python.org">python</a> through <a href="codecademy.com">codeacademy</a> and various online tutorials, I just can‚Äôt keep the urge in learning a web development framework and dive right into it.</p>

<p>Actually, my learning path started with Django at first (strangely) with most basic knowledge(syntax knowledge) of python. I studied the django tutorials and also gone half way through the ‚ÄúBuilding your first Django app‚Äù, everything seen clear at that point, but if I pass it on and came back to that another day it will look alien to me. I was moving nowhere. Then, I realized that the reason I am struggling here is I seriously don‚Äôt know anything and I am just believing that I know Python basics.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I stopped the tutorial right there and deleted all the work done on setting up the django environment completely, to come back with some real python knowledge equipped. Then I went to <a href="learnpythonthehardway.com">learnpythonthehardway</a>, it was very clear and concise in how to setup the environment and how to begin with (complete self serve) but then, I felt I was still not getting a grasp of some of the important concepts around OOPS concept.</p>

<p>Then only I returned to my all-time favorite codecademy. Whenever, I complete a lesson in Codecademy, I quickly read it in the official python tutorial (codecademy still doesn‚Äôt include some of the deeper concepts, but it‚Äôs sufficient to get a hold of the language).</p>

<p>After two weeks of this doing and learning, I completed it day before yesterday, only to start another confusion - Flask or django for the framework.</p>

<p>Since, I got my hands already dirty with django, I was slightly biased towards flask since it was branded as a simple framework (you install django at the very first of your learning, you‚Äô ll know what simple framework means).</p>

<p>So, after all of the readings and reviews and testing some of the tasks in both the language, I decided I will START with Flask and of course will move to Django only when I could write a simple DB integrated app in flask all by myself.</p>

<p>Stay tuned.</p>
