I"ï<p>Today my Github streak turned 50. Yes, Iâ€™ve been trying to maintain it and yes Iâ€™m writing a blog post about it.</p>

<p>Few weeks ago me and my <a href="https://twitter.com/hindupuravinash">friend</a> were casually chatting up about the github streak and how <a href="https://github.com/karan">people</a> <a href="https://github.com/akerl">are</a> keeping up to it continuously for months (even years) and how recruiting revolves around the commits one has publicly done, flaws in the system, benefits of it and etc., After the chat we wanted to try how hard it will be to maintain the streak and so we started a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_%28Weir_novel%29">bet</a> within ourselves on who loses the streak first.</p>
