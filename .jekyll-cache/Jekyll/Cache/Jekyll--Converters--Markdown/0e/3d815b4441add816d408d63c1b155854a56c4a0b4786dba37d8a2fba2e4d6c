I"H<p>I previously wrote about having a better journal app for pouring out my private my thoughts and how it is non-existent, so, I set out to write one. This is to announce that I have built one and released to users last month.</p>

<p>It is <a href="http://www.startwriting.in">startwriting.in</a>.</p>

<p>It has the exact structure for a simple journal, nothing fancy, yet. This was released some 40 days ago itself and I shouldâ€™ve written this post by then. But, I was in a vacation and came back just yesterday.</p>

<p>So, give it a whirl and shoot me note what you think.</p>
