I"©<p>As in my recent posts, I have been involved in heavy migrations this month and one of the main thing I am migrating is from Python to Ruby. It was indeed an big leap considering Python was my first language of choice (excluding Java, C++, .NET that I learned while in college) and was a bit indulged with it, it was hard to get familiar into another one. This was required for the next job I am switching in 40 days.</p>
