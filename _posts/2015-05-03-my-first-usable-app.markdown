I previously wrote about having a better journal app for pouring out my private my thoughts and how it is non-existent, so, I set out to write one. This is to announce that I have built one and released to users last month.

It is [startwriting.in](http://www.startwriting.in).

It has the exact structure for a simple journal, nothing fancy, yet. This was released some 40 days ago itself and I should've written this post by then. But, I was in a vacation and came back just yesterday.

So, give it a whirl and shoot me note what you think.
