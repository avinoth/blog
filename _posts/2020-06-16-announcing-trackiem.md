For the past couple of months, I've been working on a new side project of mine and I'm delighted to announce its Public beta launch. [trackiem](https://www.trackiem.com)

## Motivation

I've always been interested in tracking various aspects of my life and figuring out patterns between those. Like number of coffees, or whether I worked out that day or the number of books I read and so on. For this, I have tried using specific tracker tools before, but they always are too constrained in its nature. Often they are built for a specific niche, like habit tracking / finance tracking, etc.

I wanted something generic that would just offer me the right tools and let me configure my trackers the way I want. Hence, Trackiem.

## The tools

If you dissect any "trackers" out there, its made up 3 major components.

1. Tracker information
    - Basic information that lets you identify your tracker. Like, name, question that you'd ask yourself to record the answer.
2. The Tracker type
    - Are you recording a Yes / No type or Numbers or Strings. For eg, to track whether you did a workout, you need to register `Yes/No`, whereas if you'd like to track say your weight, its `Numbers`
3. Frequency
    - What is the period you are tracking the data for. Is it daily, weekly, monthly or on-demand. For eg: Your daily workout would be a combination of `Daily` & `Yes/No`

With just these 3 components, you could have a wide range of trackers. Some examples that could be built with these components where there are dedicated apps out there,

- Daily workout tracker
- Weight tracker
- Daily money spend
- Generic "Activity" tracker
- Books read
- and so on...

On top of these 3 tools, Trackiem also provides reminders for you to, well, remember the checkins and Charts and graphs so that you can visualize the data you have recorded. As with anything, both reminders & charts are customizable to your taste.

### What next?

As Trackiem is now in Public beta, more and more such tools are actively being integrated. I have planned some exciting things down the line, some of which are

- Define your own tracker type. Call it Time, Money, Weight, etc.,
- Customize your reminders on how much to receive, when to receive
- Third party integrations for you to automatically record the data for your trackers.
- Build  your own dashboard. With the data accumulated on various trackers, build your own way of visualizing things.
- and much much more..

This is just the start, and I'm so excited for its future down the line! If you are interested, make sure to check it out and [give it a try here](https://www.trackiem.com)
