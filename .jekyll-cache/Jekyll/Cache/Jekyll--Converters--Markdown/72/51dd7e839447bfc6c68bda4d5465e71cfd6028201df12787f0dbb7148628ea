I"Ò<p>As you probably know, <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> is a popular version control software used in projects across the globe. One of the major feature and one that distinguishes it from other tools is itâ€™s branching mechanism. Code is usually tracked via commits and grouped by branches in git.</p>

<p>As the branches are lightweight and disposable itâ€™s very easy to get cluttered when many people are working on a project or if there are many branches. And so, as anything with software, naming a git branch will itself need a standard convention to be followed in a project to keep it organized and sane. There are many naming formats out there and several project specific ones Iâ€™ve worked with.</p>
