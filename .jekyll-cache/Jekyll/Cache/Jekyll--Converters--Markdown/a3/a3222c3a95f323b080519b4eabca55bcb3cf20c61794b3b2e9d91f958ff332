I"˜<p>This is a follow-up post to my previous article on <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/password-less-authentication-in-rails/">how to implement passwordless authentication in rails</a> in sitepoint. It basically talks about how to implement login with just rails model, controller and a login token.</p>

<p>Recently I received an requirement to build a Password-less authentication system for a client project and while I wanted to do the way I have written in the article, I was looking out for if any viable options are out there since itâ€™s been 3 years. And there is one. I stumbled across <a href="https://github.com/mikker/passwordless/">passwordless</a> by mikker. Itâ€™s basically a gem that you can add it to your Rails project and get the password-less authentication system enabled.</p>

<p>Barring couple of hiccups I faced (project specific requirements, the PRs were promptly addressed), the gem works neatly as advertised. Iâ€™ve used it for the project and itâ€™s running smoothly in production now.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s why this entry. I wanted to share the gem because itâ€™s a nice solution for something I advertise a lot(get rid of those passwords!).</p>
