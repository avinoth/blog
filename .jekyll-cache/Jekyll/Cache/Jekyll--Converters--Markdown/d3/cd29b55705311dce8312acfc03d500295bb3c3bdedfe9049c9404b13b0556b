I"@<p>Yes, you read it right. I have been learning Python as you can see from my blog for almost 6 months now and have developed some decent apps too.</p>

<p>It has been an fun ride overall and looking back myself 6 months before, I really couldn’t believe how my life was without knowing everything now. I learned more python and web development in general to an greater extent, got familiar with frameworks and much more.. But, in a span of weeks there is no more “SysAdmin by profession and WebDev by heart”, Only “WebDev by profession, by heart and by soul”.</p>
