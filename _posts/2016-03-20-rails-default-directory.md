This is an update post that my recent article about Rails default directory structure is now published at [sitepoint](http://www.sitepoint.com/a-quick-study-of-the-rails-directory-structure/).

I wrote this tutorial because I was overwhelmed by the list of the files that rails generates when I first starting to learn it. And I badly wanted an thorough explanation of what each file is and what it does. Hope it proves helpful.
