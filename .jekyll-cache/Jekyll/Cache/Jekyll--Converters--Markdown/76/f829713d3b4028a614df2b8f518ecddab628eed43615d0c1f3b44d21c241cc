I"><p>After a lot of confusions and searching I decided to begin with Flask framework first, since Django is pretty complicated (for beginning).</p>

<p>After some three days of learning and practicing Flask I must say, I’m lovin it. At the very beginning, I thought that as it is mentioned as a micro framework it can be used only for minimal applications, but I was totally wrong. As pointed in many blog posts and forums, don’t get fooled by the phrase micro framework. It can do as much as what other frameworks can do for you and that too in a simplified manner.</p>
