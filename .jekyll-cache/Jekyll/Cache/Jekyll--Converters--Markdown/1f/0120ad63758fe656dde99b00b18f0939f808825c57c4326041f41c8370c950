I"ç<p>For the last few days, I was quite in an Hibernate mode from the Internet life. I actually was completely off the internet even from the mobile for the past one week due to my exams. Well, the period turned more awful than to think of.,</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>First, I missed more important mails to be addressed in a quicker time making the worst first impressions to some important people.. seriously IMPORTANT people..</p>

<p>If you would have referred my older posts, I was in a learning spree with programming. well, to resume for it became difficult.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve already completed much of the online courses and was doing some programming competitions in coderbyte, pyschools, to get into the advanced stuff. And, I was in such a good pace while doing it until when I hit those brakes. After the comeback, it felt quite tough to get back on track with such a speed Iam used to previously.</p>

<p>Important lesson learned, Consistency.. Though I spent that off time in studying computer science for exams, but it was different than what I was doing. It was more kind of logical learning and more about machine internals.</p>

<p>Added to the mails, I also missed many tech related events like for instance Apple‚Äôs acquisition of Beats, Apple‚Äôs WWDC, Swift, and much more which was really amusing while I read it a week after it actually happened.</p>

<p>So, is this it? A period of humans‚Äô increased dependency with technology. Are we finally become completely dependent?</p>

<p>I would say more or less. Those of you think it is not that much of a risk, take a week off computer completely. You will receive all of the important mails in that period.</p>
