I"û<p>If you by any chance came across my <a href="http://blog.avinoth.com/who-am-i-a-developer-or-a-system-administrator/">previous</a> posts or read the <a href="http://blog.avinoth.com/about-me">about</a> page, you would know by now that I am a newborn programmer. I have been a System administrator for almost 3 years with MNCs when the thought begun to grip inside me that I want to become a programmer. Not python, not ruby, but a Programmer. As in my blog tag line I want to become the other type.</p>
