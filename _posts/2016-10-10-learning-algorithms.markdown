[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) just launched an [Algorithms specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms) with courses previously from Algorithm Design and Analysis course and with some new assignments. This is a four course specialization with each course spanning 4 weeks.

I'm going to finish this specialization and planning to log my progress throughout here. It'll basically contain my perspective on the course and my learnings throughout.

I'll be taking this course as a beginner since my Algorithms knowledge is quite rusty since I've learned them during my Diploma and Bachelor's degree. So, the take on the course would be from my point of view inline with my experience.

Along with the coursera course, I'll also be taking supplemental learnings from MIT OCW on [mathematics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/index.htm) and a reboot on Data structures from [geeksforgeeks](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/).

Wish me luck :)
