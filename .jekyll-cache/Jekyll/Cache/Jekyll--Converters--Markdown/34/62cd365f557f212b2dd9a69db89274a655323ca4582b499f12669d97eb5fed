I"v<p>Today I would like to talk about Materialized views (henceforth referred as matviews) and how to add it to an Rails app.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-matviews">What is Matviews?</h3>

<p>From wikipedia,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A materialized view is a database object that contains the results of a query.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, matviews are similar to database views except they are stored in disk and updated periodically. Matviews stores the result of an query into a table like structure of its own, from which the data can be queried on. We canâ€™t add or delete rows from it but rest it behaves as an actual table.</p>
