I"<p>Ever since I have completed my basics in <a href="python.org">python</a> through <a href="codecademy.com">codeacademy</a> and various online tutorials, I just can’t keep the urge in learning a web development framework and dive right into it.</p>

<p>Actually, my learning path started with Django at first (strangely) with most basic knowledge(syntax knowledge) of python. I studied the django tutorials and also gone half way through the “Building your first Django app”, everything seen clear at that point, but if I pass it on and came back to that another day it will look alien to me. I was moving nowhere. Then, I realized that the reason I am struggling here is I seriously don’t know anything and I am just believing that I know Python basics.</p>
