I"€<p>Itâ€™s been a while since I last blogged here. Couple of reasons, first Iâ€™m working on a exciting <a href="http://apisquid.com">idea</a> of mine. second, Iâ€™ve decided to write technical articles on <a href="https://sitepoint.com/author/avinoth">sitepoint</a> from this month. Actually the true and main reason is I purchased Counter Strike Go last month and thatâ€™s what keeping my hands off the editor.</p>

<p>So, about the title. Yeah, Iâ€™ve been looking forward learning new language(s) this year which has been going pretty well. I started with golang since it is my first static typed language. It is fun and Iâ€™m still keeping up to it. Now, Iâ€™m planning to start with Elixir, which is a Functional programming language and there has been lots of talks around it. One special thing about elixir is itâ€™s ruby-esque syntax and the concurrency model from erlang.</p>

<p>Right after Iâ€™ve made up my mind to start with elixir, the question came whether I should start erlang first or elixir and after lots of to and fro between the documentation, Iâ€™ve decided to start with Erlang first and work my way towards Elixir.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve started with <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/jaerlang2/programming-erlang">Programming Erlang by Joe Armstrong</a> and so far Iâ€™ve completed two chapters. Iâ€™ll be honest, Erlang seems bizarre with more unconventional way from the languages Iâ€™ve known. With equal sign being pattern matching operator to variables that can only hold constant value. It will take some getting used to. But one thing for sure, I canâ€™t wait to get my hands on Elixir and build awesome stuff with it.</p>
