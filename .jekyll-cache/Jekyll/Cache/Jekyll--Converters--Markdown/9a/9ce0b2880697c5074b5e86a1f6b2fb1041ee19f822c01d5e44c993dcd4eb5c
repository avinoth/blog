I"ü<p>Google, Itâ€™s like a Walmart for Internet services. You can get whatever you want from its portfolio of products ranging from Email to Wedding planner, it wants to simplify everythingâ€¦ literally everything.</p>

<p>Now, thatâ€™s a good thing to have all our needs and services under one roof.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>â€œOne account - For Every Google servicesâ€
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>thatâ€™s how Google letâ€™s you manage all of your google services from only one account. Thereâ€™s a long going debate whether thatâ€™s a better or bad thing, I am not going into that, itâ€™s upto you for deciding. But, as the saying goes, Never put all your eggs in one basket and why is that?</p>
