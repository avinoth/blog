Lately, finding an open source project to contribute for beginners is so daunting and hard to find. I myself, searched and searched to find an apt project that will use my skills and knowledge level for the contribution, but as it turns out it is near impossible to find an actual required contribution.

So, to fix the gap and to help myself and others like me I have created my first Github repository for this purpose. OpenSourceForBeginners is the repository name.

##### How it works?

So, what’s the best way to find a project that requires contribution which is not matured and advanced enough? to get it from the project creators itself.

I have created a repository that enables the OSS repo owners in Github to post a link under an indexed programming language that repo is created in, its project name, the repo link, level of skill required and the required skill for the contributor.

As of now, it’s just a plain doc with just examples with no real repo links. Check it out if you have any suggestions.
