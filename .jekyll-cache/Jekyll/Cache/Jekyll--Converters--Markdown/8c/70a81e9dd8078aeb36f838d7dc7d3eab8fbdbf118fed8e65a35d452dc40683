I"‰<p><a href="https://www.coursera.org">Coursera</a> just launched an <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms">Algorithms specialization</a> with courses previously from Algorithm Design and Analysis course and with some new assignments. This is a four course specialization with each course spanning 4 weeks.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m going to finish this specialization and planning to log my progress throughout here. Itâ€™ll basically contain my perspective on the course and my learnings throughout.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll be taking this course as a beginner since my Algorithms knowledge is quite rusty since Iâ€™ve learned them during my Diploma and Bachelorâ€™s degree. So, the take on the course would be from my point of view inline with my experience.</p>

<p>Along with the coursera course, Iâ€™ll also be taking supplemental learnings from MIT OCW on <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/index.htm">mathematics</a> and a reboot on Data structures from <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/">geeksforgeeks</a>.</p>

<p>Wish me luck :)</p>
